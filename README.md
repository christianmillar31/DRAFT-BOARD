## üéØ VBD System Details

### Dynamic vs Static VBD

**Static VBD (Traditional)**:
- Uses fixed replacement levels (QB12, RB24, WR36, TE12)
- Based on theoretical league-average roster construction
- Consistent throughout the draft regardless of actual picks

**Dynamic VBD (Revolutionary)**:
- Recalculates replacement levels in real-time based on actual draft state
- Adjusts for positional runs and scarcity as they happen
- Accounts for how many players at each position have actually been drafted
- Provides scarcity bonuses when positions become depleted
- Shows remaining players available at each position

**Example**: If 15 RBs have been drafted early, dynamic VBD recognizes the remaining RBs are more valuable than static calculations suggest, automatically increasing their VBD scores.

### Tiered Point Projections
The system uses realistic, position-specific tiers that mirror actual NFL performance patterns:

**Running Backs** (steep early drop, cliff after RB18):
- Elite (1-6): 315 - (5.5 √ó rank) ‚Üí RB1: 310pts, RB6: 282pts
- Mid (7-18): 325 - (7.0 √ó rank) ‚Üí RB12: 241pts, RB18: 199pts  
- Late (19+): 235 - (2.4 √ó rank) ‚Üí RB29: 165pts

**Wide Receivers** (moderate early, steep mid, then flatten):
- Elite (1-8): 290 - (4.0 √ó rank) ‚Üí WR1: 286pts, WR8: 258pts
- Mid (9-28): 300 - (5.0 √ó rank) ‚Üí WR20: 200pts, WR28: 160pts
- Late (29+): 160 - (0.25 √ó rank) ‚Üí WR41: 150pts

### Replacement Level Calculations

**Static Replacement Levels**:
- **Standard League**: QB12, RB24, WR36, TE12 based on roster requirements
- **Superflex League**: QB gets 30% flex allocation, dramatically increasing QB values
- **Custom Flex Weights**: Configurable via league settings for any format

**Dynamic Replacement Levels**:
- **Real-Time Calculation**: Based on actual players drafted and remaining roster needs
- **Position Scarcity Tracking**: Monitors how many players at each position have been taken
- **Remaining Need Assessment**: Calculates how many more players will be drafted at each position
- **Live Adjustment**: Replacement level = the Nth best remaining player where N = remaining draft need

### Strength of Schedule
- **Complete 2025 Schedule**: All 17 games for each team
- **Position-Specific Rankings**: Teams ranked 1-32 vs QB/RB/WR/TE separately
- **¬±8% Point Adjustments**: Clamped to prevent extreme swings
- **Real Defensive Data**: Based on official NFL defense vs position statistics

## üéÆ Dynamic VBD Usage

2. **Live Updates**: VBD values automatically update as players are drafted
3. **Enhanced Tooltips**: Hover over VBD values to see both static and dynamic calculations
4. **Scarcity Indicators**: See remaining players at each position and scarcity bonuses

### Dynamic VBD Tooltip Information
